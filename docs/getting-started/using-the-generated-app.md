# Using the generated app

After you publish your application to the Amplication cloud, you can immediately start using your application REST API. 

Below you can find a Postman collection with example requests on how to create, update, delete, and list entities on the sample application provided with your account.

{% hint style="info" %}
 This Postman collection is configured to use the default username and password shipped with your app. Username "admin" and password "admin".

You can use the _Users_ _API_  to create more users or change the default password.      
{% endhint %}

To use this collection, first publish the sample application from your Amplication account. 

Click the button below to open the collection,

In the collection settings set the  &lt;app-url&gt; variable with your application published URL.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/e6dd386df7efe7d31343)

{% hint style="info" %}
 Your application is published to a URL similar to this one:  
**https://your-app-domain.amplication.app**

If you published your app anywhere else, you can still use the postman collcetion with your own URL.
