# Amplication Server

Amplication Server is the main component of the platform that provides all the core functionality to design and create low-code applications.
The server exposes a GraphQL API for all actions. The server is built with the following awesome open source technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma over PostgreSQL, GraphQL API, and many more...

### Development

#### One time set up

| :bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js, Docker, and Git are installed |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |


- Install dependencies of the monorepo (execute in root directory):
  ```
  npm install
  npm run bootstrap
  ```
- Update code generated by Prisma
  ```
  npm run prisma:generate
  ```
- Build dependencies of the server:
  ```
  npm run build -- --scope amplication-server --include-dependencies
  ```
- Update other generated code
  ```
  npm run generate
  ```
- Make sure Docker is running
- Get database services up (execute in server directory "packages/amplication-server")
  ```
  npm run docker:db
  ```
- Update application database (execute in server directory "packages/amplication-server")
  ```
  npm run start:db
  ```

##### Optional: Google Cloud Platform

If you use the Google Cloud Platform integration make sure to execute:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Workflow

- Start the development server and watch for changes
  <<<<<<< HEAD

  ```
  npm run start:watch

- Format files (editors like VSCode can do it for you automatically)
  ```
  npm run format
  ```
- Lint files (editors like VSCode come with integration to display those continuously)
  ```
  npm run lint
  ```
- Run tests and watch for changes
  ```
  npm run test:watch
  ```
- When needed, update Prisma Schema
  ```
  npm run migrate:save
  npm run migrate:up
  npm run prisma:generate
  ```
